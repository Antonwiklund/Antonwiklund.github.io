## Additional thoughts on the examination

I have kept coming back to the examination the last couple of days, partly since I realize more things which could be incorporated or manipulated, but also since I'm unsure whether I will pass the exam. I try to implement "not only the standard stuff", but since I'm so new to css etc, this is somewhat complicated.

In any case, I enjoy configuring the site more and more. A problem I have right now concerns the markdown, and I will google it after I add this post. But, how do I add classes and ID's via MD, or is it even possible? One more thing I will try to find out is where the root for the page is located. Right now I'm not sure how to manipulate the whole page. How do I add classes and ID's? How do I configure the basic HTML layout of the page? This is something I really should look into.

Additionally, I was severely bored with the "webbteknik" course, since it was so incredebly basic and repetetive. And even if I understand the reason for it being just that, this kind of way of configuring websites does interest me a lot more, as it seems to add such a great diversity of functionality, as well as timesaving features. I'm still not interested in going deeper than I would have to when it comes to the creation of webpages in general, but I still enjoy beginning to understand a little bit about how they are structured and can be created. The Jekyll + SASS combo could serve a lot of purposes it seems.
