## General thoughts previous to handing in examination for grading.

I think that the SCSS way of doing things makes a lot of sense. It's been a bit much for me to start so soon with, but I have a much better understanding of the way preprocessors work now, than I did 1 week ago.  
Perhaps there could had been a more available tutorial provided, where it would be possible to find hints regarding what to read etc. But in the end I think it was maybe good that there actually wasn't.  
I think like that since the lack of information has had me sit and explore the various folders, read the readme's etc.

I can't say I enjoy creating websites. It feels to me like a horrible waste of time, since it's not something I want to be doing. However, I guess there is a relevance in understanding the basic concepts of how to create websites etc, since websites and the internet is such a huge part of the computers world and thus i suppose, potentially, the programmers.

I look forward to moving on now, and returning to the more programming oriented part.
