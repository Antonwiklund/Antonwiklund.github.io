## Final thoughts on the examination

I looked up the things I was thinking about in the last post, and found that I can implement straight HTML-code in the markdown file, so that answers how I can use class, id and other things in markdown.

I also looked up how to find the root file for the website in Jekyll, and it seems that this root file doesn't really exist. It seems to me that the website is made up of several files which Jekyll processes into one single webpage. 

In any case, I've begun the JS exercises and have finished the ones for lecture 03. I will continue these studies after I have updated the examination with this blogpost.
