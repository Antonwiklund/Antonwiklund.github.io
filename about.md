#### My name is Anton Wiklund, and I'm taking this course over the internet.
I have just begun studying computer science, as in I have only used computers to satisfy more general purposes previously. Purposes such as using email, watching movies, listen to music, reading news etc.

I decided to study computer science due to wanting to get a proper education which will last me for a long time, as well as providing me with a certain amount of freedom and purpose.  
It seems to me that computer science satisified these demands the best, and when I found out that Linn√©universitet provided a whole program, which in addition to this also seems to be held in high regard, it was not a terribly hard choice to choose what to apply to.  
That it is held over the internet also satisfies me, since it means I can decide for myself when and where to study.

When I finish my studies I would like to work for a few years, building my general knowledge within a working environment. After this I would like to perhaps become a teacher on a more basic level.

Computer science is not my passion, but I do enjoy it, and enjoy it more as my knowledge increases and I feel more at home within it. But in the end I choose this program primarily because it seems like a safe bet for myself, which I might also be able to use in order to provide others with something relevant. My real passion lies in the workings of the human language, and I will continue these studies. At the same time, how the languages of the computers and programs work is also interesting. But they seem to be very bound by rules, so the traditional freedom of writing is a bit dilluted. But it is only logical, so I don't mind. I still enjoy the courses I'm taking, and even if they are very disruptive to my emotional energy, I find great satisfaction in finally getting an algorithm to work as it is intended to work.
